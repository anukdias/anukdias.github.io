I'm going into my final year as an undergrad at the University of Minnesota, pursuing a double major in Psychology and Computer Science with honors. I'm interested in finding simple rules that can govern complex systems. I have explored this interest by exploring the parameters associated with brain criticality, studying the developmental cues that lead to racial biases, and innovating in the med tech space.

I illustrate the questions driving each of these interests of mine, as well as the progress I've made in my pursuit of knowledge in my projects page.
